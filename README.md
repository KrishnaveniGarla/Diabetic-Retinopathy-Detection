# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection

Diabetic retinopathy is a condition suffered by people who have diabeties, which leads to permenent blindness if not treated in time. 

We propose a novel and efficient method to diagnose retinopathy from retinal fundas images using SVM and KNN algorithms.

We also try out deep learning based solutions with grad cam scores to show the area of interest from the model pov.

This project was selected for the *Google AI ML Mentorship Bootcamp* as one among the 20 projects from around India.
